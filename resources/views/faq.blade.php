                    This depends on where you are in the world. In the some countries a psychologist has a three year bachelor’s degree and in other’s is required to have a PhD. What is most important is to  find a professional that has the training, experience and the background to work with the areas you are concerned about. It is important you feel comfortable with the counsellor/therapist as well. You should check the professionals credentials, experience, background and that they are qualified to practice. <br/>
                    <br/>

                                               because they think they are “in trouble” or that “something is wrong with them”. You can reassure them about how counselling works and what they might gain.  Identifying their reasons for not wanting to come can sometimes help provide information to help them see the benefits.

Depending on how well you know the person, you can choose a brief acknowledgement through eye contact, a nod, saying hello or a smile will do.  If they start a conversation, you can keep your responses brief or choose to talk about other things.

                                     <p>Confidentiality for teens is very complex. The developmental needs of a 14 year old and a 17 year old are very different. Many times teens are coming to counselling because they need a safe confidential place to talk about things that are going on in their lives that they are not comfortable sharing with other adults in their lives. While the counselors support and try to encourage increased communication between teens and their parents/guardians, this is not always possible. <br/><br/> Generally, counsellors will provide a confidential “bubble” for teens unless there is a serious safety concern. And most often, when a counselor decides to break a teens confidentiality they will have a conversation with the teen before that happens. The purpose of the conversation will be to help the teen in understanding the counsellors decision to break confidentiality and invite the teen to be a part of the conversation with the guardians if they chose to do so. </p>
